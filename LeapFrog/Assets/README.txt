I iterated by at first just having the players move around on an empty plain by themselves. Then once I made sure all the scores and stuff worked
I made it so that the players have some obstacles to jump on and around so they can have a little more strategy to their jumping.

I added challenge by adding the obstacles. I also added an indirect action by adding a powerup that changes the speed of a player.
