I iterated by at first just having the players move around on an empty plain by themselves. Then once I made sure all the scores and stuff worked
I made it so that the players have some obstacles to jump on and around so they can have a little more strategy to their jumping.

I added challenge by adding the obstacles. I also added an indirect action by adding a powerup that changes the speed of a player.

Added a win to the game by whenever either player jumps over the other 4 times their score in the top left and right corners will go up and then
eventually will say "X player won!" in the middle of the screen.
